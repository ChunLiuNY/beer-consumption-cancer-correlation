Does time spent sleeping affect your chance of getting cancer?

## Project Description
Cancer is a disease of genetic mutation and also that environment can play a huge role, e.g. food consumption, life habits, etc. In this project, I would like to understand if there is a correlation between time spent sleeping and chance of getting cancer. Will a person who sleeps less than average have a higher chance of getting cancer? I will analyze global cancer data by country and gender compared with time spent sleeping for men vs women to see if we can find correlation that might support the claim.  

## Data Description
1. The CI5 database contains incidence rates from 343 cancer registries in 65 countries for cancers diagnosed from 2008 to 2012, for all cancers and 28 major types. There is one with population metrics, and one for the cancer cases reported. Population data includes columns for Registry (reporting location), Year, Sex, Total population, and remaining columns are the breakdowns by age range (every 5 years). The Case files include columns to indicate the Registry, Year, Sex, Cancer type code, and the same 5 year age range counts. 
2. The Our World in Data site provides a chart and downloadable .csv of the Time spent sleeping per day men vs women data for each country from 1998 to 2015.
