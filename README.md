Does time spent sleeping affect your chance of getting cancer?

## Project Description
Cancer is a disease of genetic mutation and also that environment can play a huge role, e.g. food consumption, life habits, etc. In this project, I would like to understand if there is a correlation between time spent sleeping and chance of getting cancer. Will a person who sleeps less than average have a higher chance of getting cancer? I will analyze global cancer data by country and gender compared with time spent sleeping for men vs women to see if we can find correlation that might support the claim.
